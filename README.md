# Age Teller

Little age teller app to practice using [recompose library](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) - which I have been eager to try since discovering it recently. Started with the first mini app in the free Udemy [React JS - Mastering Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-js-mastering-redux) series to get going and expanded on it.

## Built With

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
* [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Running the tests

Tests have been written for the two components and the function to calculate the date difference.

```
  yarn test
```
